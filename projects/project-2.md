Investigated epoxy-based carbon–glass fiber reinforced composites with SiC particle reinforcement to improve impact resistance, fracture toughness, and wear performance. Conducted experimental characterization supported by numerical analyses, and applied the optimized material to offshore wind turbine blade design using CFD-based wind load analysis and structural simulations. Validated numerical results with experimental data and performed blade geometry optimization.
