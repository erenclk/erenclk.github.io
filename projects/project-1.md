With fossil fuel resources becoming increasingly scarce and their harmful effects on the environment growing steadily, including global warming and air pollution, the trend towards using renewable energy sources is growing worldwide. Among the various renewable energy systems, wind energy stands out for its cost-efficiency and sustainability. Through higher wind speeds, offshore wind turbines generate a significant potential for electricity production for coastal countries. However, high wind speeds and open sea rains have certain disadvantages on turbine blades, such as wind and raindrop erosion damage. Besides, rapidly moving rotor blades due to the high wind speed are hardly noticed by the birds, resulting in bird collisions with the wind turbine blades. These collisions generate an impact load, which damages the blades of the wind turbine. Therefore, wear and impact resistance of the wind turbine blades should be increased for reliable service life. Micro-cracks can develop due to micro-scale damage from received impacts and cause material failure below the maximum tensile stress. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the fracture toughness of these blades. This study aims to improve a composite material to be used in the manufacture of wind turbine blades. In this regard, reinforcements were used to improve the impact resistance, fracture toughness, and wear resistance of the developed composites. Accordingly, epoxy-based carbonâ€“glass fiber reinforced composites are produced by using micro silicon carbide (SiC) particles as a secondary reinforcement. According to the literature review, it is seen that there are no comprehensive studies on the effects of secondary reinforcement on impact strength and fracture toughness. Hybrid composite structure with improved surface hardness, impact resistance, and fracture toughness reinforced with micro SiC particles to be produced in the study has not been seen in the literature. In addition to experimental studies such as impact resistance and fracture toughness tests and practical numerical studies were performed to verify the experimental results. With this study, it was intended to examine the effects of reinforcements on mechanical properties, and to determine an optimal composition to achieve these properties. For offshore wind turbine blades, blade airfoil geometry was determined and the blade was modeled with a 3D modeling tool. Based on this modeling, firstly the wind load is calculated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis. Then, using the calculated wind load, the stress and deformation on the wind turbine blades are determined by structural analysis. The material modeling of the composites to be manufactured is performed. After manufacturing of composites, experimental characterization is performed. Then, optimization of turbine blade is made. At the end of the study, experimental data is compared with numerical results for validation.
