This study aims to improve a composite material to be used in the manufacture of wind turbine blades. In this regard, reinforcements were used to improve the impact resistance, fracture toughness, and wear resistance of the developed composites. Accordingly, epoxy-based carbonâ€“glass fiber reinforced composites are produced by using micro silicon carbide (SiC) particles as a secondary reinforcement. In addition to experimental studies such as impact resistance and fracture toughness tests and practical numerical studies were performed to verify the experimental results. With this study, it was intended to examine the effects of reinforcements on mechanical properties, and to determine an optimal composition to achieve these properties. For offshore wind turbine blades, blade airfoil geometry was determined and the blade was modeled with a 3D modeling tool. Based on this modeling, firstly the wind load is calculated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis. Then, using the calculated wind load, the stress and deformation on the wind turbine blades are determined by structural analysis. The material modeling of the composites to be manufactured is performed. After manufacturing of composites, experimental characterization is performed. Then, optimization of turbine blade is made. At the end of the study, experimental data are compared with numerical results for validation.
