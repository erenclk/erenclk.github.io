Designed and engineered a two-stage gearbox consisting of a bevel gear first stage and a helical gear second stage. Performed complete gearbox calculations including gear sizing, shaft design, and bearing selection based on a required bearing life of 15,000 hours. Developed detailed assembly and sectional drawings in the plane of the input and output shafts, along with side views and partial sections where required. Applied manufacturing tolerances and machining symbols according to technical drawing standards. Prepared a full production drawing of the gearbox output shaft suitable for manufacturing.
